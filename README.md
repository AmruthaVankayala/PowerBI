## Problem Statement

This dashboard helps to understand the sales better. It helps the to know if their sales  are increased or what is going on with their services. Through different states and different people, they get to know their improvement area, . It also lets them know the total amount , top customers, average order value(AOV), thus since by using this dashboard they can identify and analyze everything.
 New measure was created to find Average Order Value.


       Average Order Value(AOV) = [Amount]/[Quantity]
        
A card visual was used to represent AOV, Sum of amount, sum of quantity, sum of profit.

A single page dashboard was created on Power BI Desktop & it was then published to Power BI Service.
